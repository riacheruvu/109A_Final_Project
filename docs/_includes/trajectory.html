                                    <p class="text-muted">We initially tried to add genre as a feature included in our dataset, and retrieve these labels using Spotipy's API.
                                    We found that Spotify's API makes the process of obtaining genre labels complicated, since we needed to use the artists' genre labels, since the genre labels for a particular track/song are almost always empty. We were able to retrieve the genre labels and classify certain sub-categories of genres under umbrella categories (e.g. Classical and Soundtrack). We ran into issues when we identified numerous sub-genres that could be grouped into multiple different categories - for example, should "Pop Rock" be grouped into the Pop or Rock genre? Furthermore, the song produced by an artists may not have the same genre as the genre most associated with the artist, so we discarded this feature and chose to rely on the audio features instead as our foundation.</p>

                                    <p class="text-muted">As mentioned in the previous section, in order to personalize and further narrow down the generated recommendations, we built upon our baseline model by utilizing the clustering approach to interpret the clusters the initial playlist were assigned to, and recommend songs accordingly. We previously experimented with a Logistic Regression and Linear regression model to predict the pos variable, or the position of the track in the playlist. Since the pos variable can be considered as both categorical and numerical, we tried using unregularized Logistic and Linear regression models, which led to sub-optimal accuracy. We chose not to pursue this approach so we could focus on the personalization of the recommendations and the overall system pipeline combining sentiment analysis + the recommender system. </p>

We use cosine distance to determine which songs are related to our initial playlist, and subsequently determine based on the total number of related songs and the number we retrieve what our R-precision is. The winner of RecSys 2018 had a R-precision of .22, but was allowed only 3 features, we will strive to surpass this score.</p>
