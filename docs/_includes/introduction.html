                    <p> We chose to tackle the cold start problem for our project - generating a playlist of songs given a short amount of songs. Our idea was to expand more on the quality of the playlist, and answer the research question: How can we make music recommendation personalizable and automated? We will not deviate very far from this original question, however, initial exploratory analysis of the data has reshaped the way in which we will look at analysis. Our research question based on the use of additional audio features from Spotify and the EDA encompasses: Are we able to quantify music based on song features allowing for more personalized automated music recommendations?</p>
                    <p>Below, we include a picture of our system's pipeline for inference: </p>
