                 <p><b>Incorporating musical sensibilities into song recommendations is crucial for personalizing automatic playlist generation.</b> The more impulsive and customized a song is the more chances there are that it could find itself in a playlist without the choice being necessarily too complex or individualized. The less salient the details of the song, the better it is to serve as a guide to others. And the more are the details there are, the more it feels like an accurate reference.</p>

                <p>The above quote was generated by a transformer model called GPT-2 -- TODO Elaborate. We would like to leverage such capabilities for song recommendation.</p>
